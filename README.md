This is Assignment 1 README file. You are reading this because you have absolutely nothing better to do. Good for you.

This is a short description about application installation and usage.

In the code section of this repo you will find the full source code and also an executable jar file, but because this is a maven+javafx
project (2 for the price of one) that one won't work. So...if you want to run this appliaction on a clean computer you will need to follow
the steps below:
1. Install jdk8+ on your computer (installation depends on machine type and operating system)
2. Install Intelij IDEA Community Version - this will be enough you don't need the full version
3. Clone source code, and import as existing project in Intelij
now comes the fun part
4. Install Xampp Control Panel - this will help you to create and (in the future) access the database required for the project to work
5. This is optional, but is you have a clean computer i guess you have a lot of space so...install MySQL Workbench
6. In the project repo you will find 2 file, one for database creation and one for populating the database.
After you've done this, the project should pretty much work.

For further informations please read the documentation, i spent 3 hours writing and making nice looking diagrams.Thanks.
I also added a photo album, so if the application is not working you can look at the pictures.
